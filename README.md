## 01) Reconnaissance & Information Gathering

#### To check Victim's data

- [Manage and remember our `password`](https://github.com/denuwan-yasodhana/security/tree/main/To%20check%20Victim's%20data/KeePass)

	- Transfer apps to other Android devices that have no internet connectivity.
	- Take a backup of apps and store them on the computer.

- [Check Original or Duplicate/ Edit `file`](https://github.com/denuwan-yasodhana/security/tree/main/To%20check%20Victim's%20data/HashCal)
	- Can see if the data has been modified or changed.
	- Check data integrity when sent through telecommunication networks such as Internet

## 02) Scanning



## 03) Exploitation & Gaining Access

#### To connect with Victim device

- [Netcat with command prompt](https://github.com/Denuwan98/security/tree/main/To%20connect%20with%20Victim%20device/Netcat%20with%20cmd)
	- Used to know if a specific port is open and/or accepting connections.
	- Used for sending "data files" across the Internet
	- Used for sending "messages" between both devices

#### Get power of the victim's device

- [Cerberus app for only Android](https://github.com/denuwan-yasodhana/security/tree/main/Get%20power%20of%20the%20victim's%20device/Cerberus)
	- Can shut down the device.
	- If the thief tries to uninstall the app, the application will force the thief to go to the device admin settings to remove the admin privileges.
	- Can back up data on either Dropbox or Google Drive by linking any of them to Cerberus.
	- Front-camera pictures of the person who enters too many wrong passwords, then immediately send the picture to the registered email address.
	- Even if the victim has removed the SIM card, the application is allowed to be used if we know the application number.
